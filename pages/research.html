                My research focuses on understanding the complex behavior of blazars, which are among the most energetic and variable sources in the universe.
                I use a combination of observational data and advanced computational techniques such as machine learning to more accurately classify gamma-ray blazars.
                My recent work examines how machine learning models with novel weight initialization methods and self-supervised learning can improve our ability to identify these objects.
                <br>
                Additionally, I study the optical and gamma-ray variability of blazars, with a special focus on recording deep outbursts that provide important information about the jets emitted by these sources.
                My research also includes the study of ultra-high-energy photons that may originate from blazar jets, linking their activity to the most energetic phenomena in astrophysics.
                <br>
                By analyzing long-term patterns of optical variability and the nature of gamma-ray variability, I aim to explain the physical processes that drive these extreme changes in blazar emission.

                    <h3>Predicting Redshifts of Active Galactic Nuclei Using Machine Learning</h3>
                    In our recent research, we tackled the challenge of predicting redshift values for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical aspect of understanding the universe's structure. 
                    Our study, titled "Predicting Conditional Probability Distributions of Redshifts of Active Galactic Nuclei Using Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction," highlights the limitations of traditional methods, which are often expensive and complex. 
                    Instead, we turned to machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of redshift predictions. <br>
                    We employed a Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction approach that allows us to predict complex conditional probability distributions rather than just specific values. 
                    This method is particularly advantageous given that real-world data often presents uncertainties that traditional techniques struggle to accommodate. 
                    By utilizing independent Mean Squared Error estimation and linear regression, we developed interpretable models where coefficients elucidate the contributions of different features to conditional moments. <br>
                    Our findings demonstrate significant advancements in predicting AGN redshifts using data from the Fourth Fermi-LAT Data Release 3 (4LAC-DR3). 
                    By incorporating Canonical Correlation Analysis for feature optimization and l1 'lasso' regularization, we have created a robust framework that not only streamlines the prediction process but also enhances our understanding of AGN emissions. 
                    This research represents a significant step forward in astrophysical data analysis, paving the way for more accurate models in the future.

                    <h3>Long-Term X-Ray Variability Analysis of Blazar 3C 273</h3>
                    Our collaborative work, "Constraining X-Ray Variability of the Blazar 3C 273 Using XMM-Newton Observations over Two Decades," provides a comprehensive analysis of one of the most studied blazars in astrophysics. 
                    We utilized extensive X-ray observations collected over two decades to explore both long-term and short-term variability properties. <br>
                    Through sophisticated timing and spectral analysis techniques, we uncovered that 3C 273 exhibits remarkable flux variability, changing by a factor of three during our observation period. 
                    The fractional variability was estimated at 27%, indicating significant fluctuations in brightness. 
                    Our analysis employed various statistical methods, including estimation of fractional variability and power spectral density analysis, allowing us to quantify these fluctuations accurately. <br>
                    The results revealed a multimodal flux distribution across all observations, suggesting complex underlying processes at play within this blazar. 
                    Our spectral analysis indicated that a log-parabola model combined with blackbody emission provided the best fit for most observations. 
                    This work enhances our understanding of blazar behavior and contributes valuable insights into high-energy astrophysics, highlighting the intricate interactions between accretion disks and relativistic jets.

                    <h3>Classifying Gamma-Ray Blazars with Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
                    In our paper titled "Gamma-ray Blazar Classification Using Machine Learning with Advanced Weight Initialization and Self-Supervised Learning Techniques," we explored innovative machine learning applications in gamma-ray astrophysics. 
                    Our research addresses the pressing need for effective classification methods among gamma-ray-emitting sources detected by the Fermi gamma-ray telescope. <br>
                    We implemented multiple machine learning algorithms to classify sources based on their physical properties, focusing on distinguishing between blazars—specifically BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars. 
                    By employing advanced weight initialization techniques and self-supervised learning approaches, we achieved significant improvements in classification accuracy while simplifying model deployment. <br>
                    Our findings indicate that out of 1115 sources classified as uncertain types in the 4FGL-DR3 catalogue, approximately 820 can be categorized as BL Lacs and 295 as FSRQs. 
                    The efficiency of our model—achieving at least seven times faster inference compared to existing algorithms—demonstrates its potential for widespread application in astrophysical research. 
                    This work not only advances classification methodologies but also enhances our understanding of blazar populations in the universe.

                    <h3>Exploring Optical Variability in Blazars Using TESS Data</h3>
                    In our recent study titled "Exploring Short-Term Optical Variability of Blazars Using TESS," we conducted a systematic time series analysis involving multiple blazar sources observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 
                    This research represents a significant advancement in understanding optical variability among blazars. <br>
                    We identified significant optical variability among a sample of 29 blazars, revealing fractional variability ranging from 1.41% to 53.84%. 
                    By applying various statistical models to analyze light curves, we found that optical flux distributions often align with normal probability density functions, indicating complex emission mechanisms at play. <br>
                    A notable aspect of our research is its implications for understanding short-term activity states within blazars. 
                    The results suggest that optical variability may arise from multiple emission zones or distinct states of activity within these energetic objects. 
                    By employing power spectral density analysis, we further elucidated the nature of these variations, enhancing our comprehension of blazar dynamics and their underlying physical processes.
